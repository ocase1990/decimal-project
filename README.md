## Notes

Where I would go next:  
I would love to collaborate with design about style.  
Improve look of login page.  
Improve handling of time spent fetching data.  
Add hourglass like animation to show when the app is working to the user.  
Add hourglass like animation to button clicks.  
These could be circles completing.  
Collaborate with design about font size, color, weight uniform.  
Build common constrants and typeface to be used by the entire project in one common place.

Technologies to consider:  
Next.js  
TDD approach Red/Green/Refactor

Feedback:  
Data returned could be structured in more frontend friendly way.  
Ways to prevent things in 'formatInvoiceData.js' or move this type of login to backend.

Evolution:  
Establish frontend needs. Build backend with APIs to use for frontend. Reduce logic for frontend.  
Think about redux, or MobX
